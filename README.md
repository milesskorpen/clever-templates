clever-templates
================

A template generator using the Clever API.

Currently has two templates (a diploma and a student of the week form), but is easily extendable. All data comes via Clever's demo API token ( https://clever.com/developers/docs/explorer ). 

TODOs

- Update the teacher based on the selection from the drop down menu
- Get a real API key and test with live data & implement OAuth
- Print to PDF capability
- Improve / expand template library
